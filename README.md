## Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment
IITB +Upgrad Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment 
This project involves a bike-sharing system where bikes are made available for short-term use, either for a fee or for free. Users can borrow a bike from a computer-controlled "dock" by entering payment information, and the system unlocks the bike. The bike can then be returned to any dock within the same system.

## Business Objective
The goal is to model the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust business strategies to meet demand levels and customer expectations. Additionally, the model will provide insights into the demand dynamics of new markets.

## Problem Solving Methodology
-  Understanding
- Gain a thorough understanding of the data dictionary and the domain-specific uses of all columns.
- Data Visualization
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand various variables.
- Check the correlation between the variables.
- Data Preparation
- Create dummy variables for all categorical features.
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Perform scaling on the data.
- Data Modeling & Evaluation
- Create a Linear Regression model using a mixed approach (RFE & VIF/p-value).
- Check various assumptions of the model.
- Evaluate the Adjusted R-Square for both training and testing data.
- Report the final model.
